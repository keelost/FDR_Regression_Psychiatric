# FDR_Regression_Psychiatric
Here we present an analytic framework based on the FDR regression (FDRreg) approach to identify additional association signals, by integrating association evidence from GWAS summary statistics of related traits/disorders, and a wealth of biological information, which may be derived from real experimental data. For instance, the regression model could incorporate evidence from drug targets or animal models. This statistical method not only effectively controls the false discovery rate, but also may extract association evidence from multiple correlated traits related to the target phenotype. This significantly increased the likelihood of discovering novel risk loci or associated genes/pathways. 

We first applied the strategy to investigate several common types of psychiatric disorders/traits, while this proposed strategy holds the potential for discovering risk loci/genes in other complex diseases. 

For conducting false discovery rate (FDR) regression analysis, we have uploaded the example codes of analysis on bd2018 (bipolar disorder). FDReg was performed at both SNP- and gene levels. The codes encompass whole-genome analyses for SNPs (01) and genes generated by MAGMA (02), MetaXcan (03), and SMultiXcan programs (04).

The development and refinement of the current set of R code will be an ongoing process. Additionally, if necessary, codes for other psychiatric disorders and traits will be generated and shared.
