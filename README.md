# FDR_Regression_Psychiatric
Here we presented an analytic framework based on the FDR regression (FDRreg) approach to identify additional association signals, by integrating association evidence from GWAS summary statistics of related traits/disorders, and a wealth of biological information, which may be derived from real experimental data. For instance, the regression model could incorporate evidence from drug targets or animal models. This statistical method not only effectively controlled the false discovery rate, but also extracted association evidence from multiple correlated traits related to the target phenotype. This significantly increased the likelihood of discovering novel risk loci or associated genes/pathways.
